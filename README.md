## Overview
   **This project is to build a full-stack (Mongoose/Express/React/Node), professional-looking application with a functioning backend and frontend.** 
   <br>
   - The backend sever is a MongoDB with Mongoose/Express which is document-orented and offers a faster query procss. It is used as a complementary data storage to transaction SQL databases for retail stores. The information of products and reviews can be pull into MongoDB from the main SQL databases in retail stores.
   - The frondend website is implemented with React/Node as a single page application(SPA). Customers are allowed to interact with web pages, make _requests_(search, login, sign up and get(view)/post/update/delete reviews to the backend server.<br>  
In this project, I will use Faker package creating the information of products and reviews to show the process. Later will use API call from [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/) to get the data from a retail store, like Home Depot or WalMart and write into the MongoDB



## Project Requirements (MVP)

- Be a **new repo**. Create a new repo in your github and build your project there. **DO NOT** name your repository Project 2, give it a real name.
- Be written using the languages and frameworks *learned in this course so far*
- ***Not*** be written using *any other languages or frameworks ***not*** covered in this course so far* (TypeScript, Sass, jQuery, UI Frameworks, etc.)
- Have a separate directory for the frontend (client) and have your backend within the main repository.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Your README should have your name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Include a minimum of 2 Mongoose Schemas (models)
- Have Full CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations
- Display data from each model on the frontend (unless given an exemption on one by an Instructor)
- Must be able to navigate between different pages (React Router)
- Have at least **40 _meaningful_ `git` commits**. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

**Project _Completed_ Due Date:** 12/23/21 by 1:30pm EST


## Post-MVP Ideas

**Before attempting _any_ of these post-MVP ideas, you must demonstrate your working MVP to your instructor, then attempt these on a _new branch_ 

- Hidden routes usign conditional rendering to mimic the functionality of user authentication
- Associate 2 or more of your models
- Integrate unit testing
- Integrate a 3rd party API (Ask us for a list)
